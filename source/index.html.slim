            | "The Ethotecture" text is a stub for further research that states the main ideas raised from the base theoretical question (using Quentin Meillassoux vocabulary) on how can the world be represented and processed from a non-corelationist perspective? Is there a precedent? What example, what model should we consider? To answer these, we first express the uncomfortable and even dangerous endeavour of directly living, sensing and comprehending the hyperchaos. But there's someone who tried that and even created techniques on how to manage all the experience. Enter the shaman. Having the shaman as an example and model, we define the expressiveness of the world reusing the notion of Michel Foucault's "statement" to develop a non-corelationist, object-oriented world view model. Based on this model we created a semantic web ontology using OWL that it is used to annotate and represent visually (using WebVOWL software) both the text and the video.

              | The "Expressive World Ontology" (EWO) is an OWL specification that implements a pseudo-animistic, process based, object-oriented knowledge representation system. The theory behind EWO is based on contemporary philosophy: poststructuralism (Deleuze and Foucault) and speculative realism. However, the EWO world view is modeled after indigenous animism and shamanism as defined in modern anthropology.
