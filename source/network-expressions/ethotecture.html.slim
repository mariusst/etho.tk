| Reality is cruel. The world is cruel. No sufficient reason, just non-contradiction, as Meillassoux says in "After finitude". But life always creates a cover, a personal mood that protects and filters the chaotic excess of the world, its wildness (Rich's Wesen Sauvage). Either the cell membrane and cytoplasm, or the boundaries of the city and its infrastructure, the covering and the humor are the world of self-centered life or the Umwelt as von Uexküll called it. Before von Uexküll, Descartes identified then Kant described the Umwelt of Thought. For Kant, knowledge of the world depends on the conditions of possibility of thinking, correlating absolutely the knowledge of the outer objects with the Umwelt of thought. But every life with her Umwelt, and the world with her wildness. But what happens if you break through and go beyond the cover, your own humor? You will most likely die. But before this happens, you will have a moment in which you will feel, you will live the cruelty of the world, its wilderness - the thing itself. You will be malicious (Maldiney), you will become molecular, invisible (Deleuze / Guattari and Bataille) ... But can it happen to prolong that moment and try to know the world in its terms, the world of work itself? Here comes the savage, the shaman who is exemplary in his transgression techniques. The shaman works at the extremes of the Umwelt. The envelope, its own humor, are thus exposed, pierced and contaminated by the chaotic excess of the world. The shaman has the most opportunities to feel, to know the world in its terms. But the way the shaman communicates with the wilderness of the world, with its excess of chaos, is determined not only by the techniques of transplanting the Umwelt itself but also by object-oriented communication, oriented to the expressiveness of the world.

| If we try to understand the experimentation of the world in a quasi-shamanic way, then we have to abandon the idea of abstract and discrete/isolated information. We must quit measuring and quantifying, filtering. We need to replace the information with the expression. Expression is an aspect, a perspective of an object, is external information unfiltered by its own Umwelt. It is dirty, warm information. Expression can not be abstracted, potentialized, virtualized, it is material, current, immanent. The manifested expression is what Foucault called the statement. The statement can be understood as a kind of unit of measure of object-oriented communication, and the ways in which objects refer to the enunciation is the layer-structure of the world's expressiveness. The statement is the product of a network, it is the manifested expression of a being that thus makes its presence felt. So we have, first of all, the expression and the being - the first layer. Being part of a network, obviously, this first statement is perceived by another being whose first reactions are the narrative, a type of compound statement based on recursiveness, which contains the reproduction of the first statement, the identification of the being that expressed it and, very importantly, the event in which it occurred. So we have the expression and the being to which the event is added - this is the first layer of object-oriented communication and the second in the order of complexity. But recursiveness does not stop at just one level. That is why, in the network we have described so far, a third being can react that will react both to the initial statement and to its account. And the new type of complex statement on which the expressiveness of the third being is based is the argument. The argument is a reaction to the narrative, which thus identifies and highlights the communication that has been made between the being who expressed the original statement and the being who expressed its relation. This is the uppermost layer of the world's expressivity, the second invader and the third in the order of complexity. So we have the layer of the initial statement, the layer of the story and now the layer of the argument that places everything in a communication.

| The argument contains the narrative and the narrative contains the statement and all are expressed by the beings at different moments / events that can be taken over by other beings expressed in other moments than other beings, creating communication, starting over expressivity starts. Being, event, communication. Report, argument, argument. Expressions, networks, layers over layers - etotecture.
